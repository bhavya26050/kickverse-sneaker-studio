📊 Key Features Implementation

Product Customization
The customization feature allows users to personalize select sneaker models with different color options for various shoe parts (base, swoosh, laces, etc.). The implementation uses a combination of React state management and dynamic rendering.

Wishlist Management
Users can save products to their wishlist, which is persisted either in Supabase (for authenticated users) or localStorage (for guest users). The wishlist context provides a unified API for managing wishlist items regardless of authentication state.

Shopping Cart
The shopping cart implementation supports both authenticated and guest users, with data synchronization between local storage and Supabase. Cart items can include customization details when applicable.

Responsive Design
The UI is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes from mobile to desktop. This is achieved through Tailwind CSS utilities and responsive component design.
